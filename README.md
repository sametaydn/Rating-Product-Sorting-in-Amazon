# Business Problem
One of the most important problems in e-commerce is accurately calculating the ratings given to products after purchase.
Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce website, highlighting the product for sellers, and ensuring a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is sorting the reviews given to products correctly.
The prominence of misleading reviews directly affects the sales of the product, leading to both financial loss and customer loss. When these problems are resolved, sellers will increase their sales while customers will be able to complete their purchases smoothly.
